// --- Versioning Constants ---
// These are set at compile time from environment variables.

/// The minimum compatible version of APatch.
pub const MIN_APATCH_VERSION: i32 = unwrap_ctx!(parse_i32(env!("MIN_APATCH_VERSION")));
/// The minimum compatible version of KernelSU.
pub const MIN_KSU_VERSION: i32 = unwrap_ctx!(parse_i32(env!("MIN_KSU_VERSION")));
/// The maximum compatible version of KernelSU.

/// Absolute path to the directory where Zygisk modules are stored.
///
/// Must stay absolute. It used to be the relative `".."`, which only worked
/// because the daemon is started by `service.sh` after `cd "$MODDIR"`, so its
/// cwd is `modules/onyxzygisk` and `..` resolved to `modules/`. The WebUI runs
/// hot-plug through a separate `zygiskd hotplug` CLI process whose cwd is `/`,
/// so `..` resolved to the filesystem root there and the activation `rename`
/// from `PATH_MODULES_UPDATE_DIR` became a cross-device move:
///
///     Hot-plug apply failed: failed to move staged module into
///     ../<name>: Cross-device link (os error 18)
///
/// `/data/adb` and `/` live on different mounts, hence EXDEV. Keep this
/// absolute so no caller depends on the process cwd.

/// Absolute path to the staging directory KernelSU's `ksud` and APatch's
/// `apd` both extract new/updated modules into, ahead of swapping them into
/// `PATH_MODULES_DIR` at the next boot. Consulted directly — once that root
/// solution's own "install finished" signal says it is safe to (see
/// `zygiskd::staged_update_ready`) — so a freshly installed or updated
/// module can become injectable on the very next process fork instead of
/// requiring a reboot.

/// `mark_update`), written as the last step of installing or updating any
/// module.

// --- IPC Constants ---
// These are magic numbers used in communication with the controller.

/// IPC code indicating that Zygote has been successfully injected.

/// Defines the set of actions that can be requested from the daemon over its main Unix socket.
///
/// New variants are appended at the end only, so that a controller built
/// against an older protocol revision stays wire-compatible.
